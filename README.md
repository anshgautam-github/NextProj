ZOD ->> TypeScript first schema validation 
        EG-> we don't need to go to mongoose for email validaton , like manually we were wrtiing no empty string or
        etc, so here all the validation comes in one place. 
We can create schemas with the mongoose too, but zod -> proo -> chat-gpt why?

//in mongoose -> for an email we have to write a regex, but in zod , -> it applies regex automatically
